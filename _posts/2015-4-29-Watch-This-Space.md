title: Watch This Space

Although this site is currently empty, throughout my PhD I intend on posting project pages for each of my repositories. The repositories will contain:

- Research tools
- Circuit models/simulations
- Component models/data
- Companion code (for papers)

My current project is on lessening the computational load of solving nonlinear equations in state-space models of analogue distortion circuits. This will hopefully improve the reach of real-time with such models. Code and sound examples will clarify what I'm trying to explain! Watch this space.
