This is the companion webpage for the 18th International Conference on Digital Audio Effects submission "Improving the robustness of the iterative solver in state-space modelling of guitar distortion circuitry". The content is likely to change prior to the conference.

## Contents

* [Audio Samples](https://bholmesqub.github.io/DAFx15/Audio-Samples): *Audio samples of both the Diode Clipper and Dallas Rangemaster.*
* [Nodal DK-method Matrices](https://bholmesqub.github.io/DAFx15/Nodal-DK-Matrices): *Incidence matrices required to create Nodal DK models.*
* [Method Comparison: Guitar Signal](https://bholmesqub.github.io/DAFx15/Guitar-Signals): *A comparison of the New Iterate Method and Capped Step using a real guitar signal.*
* [SPICE Models](https://bholmesqub.github.io/DAFx15/SPICE-Models): *Links to downloadable SPICE models of the circuits.*
* [MATLAB Code](https://bholmesqub.github.io/DAFx15/MATLAB-Code): *The numerical solver used for the results written in MATLAB.*
